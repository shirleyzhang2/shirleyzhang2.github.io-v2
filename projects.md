    title: Containment Design Against Aircraft & Seismic Loading
    subtitle: Terrestrial Energy, 2020-2021
    text: >
      During my 1-year internship at Terrestrial Energy, I designed nuclear containment structures for Integral Molten Salt Reactors (IMSR) specifically against aircraft and seismic loading.

    title: Crowd-induced Floor Vibration Mitigation
    subtitle: Arup, 2020
    text: >
      During my summer internship at Arup, I performed a crowd-induced floor deflection mitigation study for Ohio State University. I also contributed to a C# application that automated design calculations to improve project efficiency.

    title: Design & analysis script for seismic-proof high rises
    subtitle: U of T Seismic Design Team, 2018 - current
    text: >
      As a co-captain, I lead the design of a scaled high-rise structure that can withstand an equivalent M9.0 earthquake while supporting 20 times its weight. Working with 3 other members, we also developed an in-house Python program with a Qt interface that automates the repetitive design process by creating thousands of iterations based on user-defined constraints.

    title: Hull design script for concrete canoes
    subtitle: U of T Concrete Canoe Team, 2017 - current
    text: >
      As a technical director and structural lead, I determined the levels of stress experienced throughout the canoe in a variety of static and dynamic loading cases such as construction, transport, and paddling. I also contributed to an in-house C++ program that optimizes hull geometry using fluid-structure interaction principles.

<!-- In my Steel and Timber Design course, I worked with a team of 5 to design a four-storey steel structure as the final course project. Structural members and connection details were selected to resist gravity and wind load cases. The gravity and moment resisting frames consisted of tension and compression members, beam columns, beam-to-column connections, brace-to-gusset-plate connections, and column base plates. <br> 
<br>
My responsibilities include constructing a 3D model in SAP2000, using design spreadsheets in Excel to ensure that the structure satisfies ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state with the most economical sections, performing hand calculations for structural components, and drafting connecting details in AutoCAD. -->
