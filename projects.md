    title: Civil Engineering internship
    text: >
      I'm currently completing a 1-year internship at Terrestrial Energy Inc. as a Civil Engineering intern. I develop, analyze, and design structural systems for Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) nuclear power plants.

    title: Structural Engineering internship
    text: >
      As a structural engineering intern at Arup, I modeled and designed steel and reinforced concrete structural systems to CSA standards using various analysis software, Excel spreadsheets, and hand calculations. I also contributed to a library of automated code calculations in C# to improve project quality and efficiency. In addition, I worked with a multi-disciplinary group of interns from North America to provide alternative solutions to a crowd-induced floor deflection problem.

    title: Geotechnical Software internship
    text: >
      In the summer of 2019, I worked at Rocscience Inc. as a Geotechnical Software intern where I developed liquefaction and ground improvement features for a 3D Soil Analysis Software using C++. My Contributions ranged from theoretical research, backend development, user interface design, and documentation. More specifically, I created and integrated dry sand settlement analysis into the existing liquefaction module, and I implemented calculation methods for the effect of ground improvement on settlement as well as soil stiffness.

      At the U of T Seismic Design Team, we design and analyze scaled models of a high-rise structure to withstand an equivalent M9.0 earthquake while supporting 20X its weight. In 2020, we achieved 6th place at an international competition by optimizing material cost, seismic performance, building footprint, and architectural flexibility. <br>
      <br>
      Since last summer, I have also been working with 3 other team members to develop an in-house Python script. The purpose is to automate the repetitive design process by creating thousands of iterations based on user-defined constraints. The program then selects the most optimal design based on user-defined metrics. In addition, we are in the process of creating a PyQT GUI interface that allows the user to view their design in 3D and modify constraint parameters.

      As the structural analysis lead last year, I work with another team member to ensure that the canoe can withstand all load cases including construction, transportation and paddling. My main responsibilities include conducting structural analysis to determine levels of stress experienced throughout the canoe in a variety of loading cases, as well as utilizing multiple methods of structural analysis such as in-house C++ programs and commercial software (Excel/Matlab). In addition, I contributed to a technical report that placed 2nd at the 2019 National Concrete Canoe Competition.

    text: >
      In my Steel and Timber Design course, I worked with a team of 5 to design a four-storey steel structure as the final course project. Structural members and connection details were selected to resist gravity and wind load cases. The gravity and moment resisting frames consisted of tension and compression members, beam columns, beam-to-column connections, brace-to-gusset-plate connections, and column base plates. <br> 
      <br>
      My responsibilities include constructing a 3D model in SAP2000, using design spreadsheets in Excel to ensure that the structure satisfies ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state with the most economical sections, performing hand calculations for structural components, and drafting connecting details in AutoCAD.
