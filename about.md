    title: Personal Introduction
    text: >
      Having grown up in a metropolitan area with a population of over 12 million, I have a deep appreciation for the built environment around me. The rapid infrastructure development required to sustain a city’s inhabitants amazes me and inspires me to contribute to this growth. <br>
      <br>
      By actively exploring innovations in different facades of Structural Engineering, I am hoping to develop a multi-disciplinary approach towards traditional Civil Engineering practices with the aid of modern technology. As a prospective structural engineer, I look forward to contributing to the field of Civil engineering and socially useful work with these skills and values.
