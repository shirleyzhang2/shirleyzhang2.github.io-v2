    title: Personal Introduction
    text: >
      Having spent my childhood in a metropolitan area with a population of over 12 million, I have always had a deep appreciation for the built environment around me. The rapid infrastructure development required to sustain a city's residents amazes me and inspires me to contribute to this growth. In addition, I am passionate about the intersection between domain expertise in traditional civil engineering knowledge and emerging technology. I hope to apply computational and data science techniques to tackle overarching challenges within infrastructure systems. <br>
      <br>
      Apart from creating innovative solutions for modern infrastructure projects, I am also interested in the management of existing infrastructure with a focus on security and resilience. Throughout my undergrad, I have gained valuable industry and research experience in the critical infrastructure sector, from designing nuclear plants against aircraft crash to improving the seismic resiliency of large Liquefied Natural Gas storage tanks. I also participated in an international competition to design a COVID-19 hospital expansion without compromising its seismic performance.<br>
      <br>
      By pursing a major in Civil Engineering and minor in Artificial Intelligience, I look forward to improving the efficiency and resilience of complex infrastructure systems using a multi-disciplinary approach.

# During my 1-year internship at Terrestrial Energy Inc., I helped develop containment buildings against aircraft impact and seismic loading for nuclear power plants. Throughout my undergrad, I have contributed to two journal publications on the seismic resilience of large Liquefied Natural Gas storage tanks. Last summer, I also worked at a global structural design firm to solve a crowd-induced floor vibration problem for university facilities. 

# By actively exploring innovations in different facades of Structural Engineering, I am hoping to develop a multi-disciplinary approach towards traditional Civil Engineering practices with the aid of modern technology. I look forward to contributing to the field of Civil engineering and socially useful work with these skills and values.
